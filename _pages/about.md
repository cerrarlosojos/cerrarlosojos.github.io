Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at Peking University's School of Computer Science, affilated with the [Programming Languages Lab, Peking University](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Di Wang](https://stonebuddha.github.io/).

My research interests lie in Programming Languages, with a current focus on Program Verification.
