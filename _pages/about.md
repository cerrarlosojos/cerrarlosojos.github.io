Hello! I am a first-year Ph.D student at Peking University's School of Computer Science, affiliated with the [Programming Languages Lab (PLL)](https://pl.cs.pku.edu.cn/), where I am advised by Prof. [Di Wang](https://stonebuddha.github.io/).

My research interests lie in Programming Languages, with a current focus on Program Verification.
